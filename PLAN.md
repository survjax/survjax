# A2 constructor API migration — specification revision 9

Branch: `a2-constructors`. A2-R1 exception alignment was committed as
`c6ef7e3`. The maintainer's 2026-09-30 request authorizes the remaining
constructor API migration: remove issue-returning constructor methods, accept
eager and traced observation inputs in the two ordinary forms, and expose
diagnostics through `data.issues`.

## Current step

Spec sections: 3.1–3.3, 6.2–6.3, 10.2 and 12.1–12.2.

Files and public API:

- `src/chronox_jax/data.py`: retain exactly `SurvivalData(...)` and
  `SurvivalData.from_bounds(...)` as construction methods; remove automatic
  host validation and the `with_issues` method; add a typed `issues` property
  decoding the stored issue bitfield. No `from_bounds_with_issues` method.
- `src/chronox_jax/_data_validation.py`: remove obsolete host-only constructor
  validation and references to the removed method, preserving normalization,
  dtype policy, argument-misuse checks and issue attribution.
- Own tests in `tests/unit/`: migrate callers to ordinary construction and
  `data.issues`; check eager, `jit` and `vmap` behavior, invalid-value masks,
  explicit host checkpoints, traced inputs, tree reconstruction and the absent
  methods. Keep tests with code in the same commit.
- `REVIEW.md`: map checks to requirements and report exact gate results.

The revision 9 specification and its acceptance criteria already require this
API; `spec/GOALS.md`, `spec/SPECIFICATION.md` and `tests/spec/` are read-only.
There are no current examples or docs modules to migrate. Historical deviation
entries retain their original wording and status.

## Verification

Run `scripts/check.sh --through A2` to cover Ruff, mypy, own tests and the
independent A2 tests in both dtype modes. Use focused A3 acceptance tests for
the removed-method and tracing checks, without claiming A3 complete. Run
`git diff --check`. If an independent test conflicts with the specification,
record the issue in `DEVIATIONS.md` and leave the test unchanged.

## Later handoff

A3 owns indexing and slicing, value-derived concrete static metadata and
compile-count tests (spec 3.2). The current all-true metadata is only a
conservative interim value. A6 owns likelihood issue propagation and explicit
failure for unimplemented observation modes. Neither is part of this step.

The traced host-checkpoint exception subtype and legacy diagnostic compatibility
remain open in spec section 13 and `DEVIATIONS.md`. This step preserves the
existing traced-checkpoint failure and does not introduce a callable alias.
